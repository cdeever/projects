# Project Navigator

This site is a gallery and roadmap of software and hardware projects I've been tinkering with over time. Some of them dig into older, retro-inspired systems—classic computing, telephony, early game hardware, and radio—while others lean into modern microcontrollers, embedded platforms, and infrastructure tools. Along the way there's also electronics repair, hardware hacking, audio and hi-fi projects, and building things from kits, mostly driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how things work. A few projects are finished, many are still evolving, and some are just ideas I want to get to. It's all here to share what I've built, what I'm working on now, and what's likely up next.
