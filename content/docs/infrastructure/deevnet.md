# Deevnet

Deevnet is an infrastructure automation ecosystem built around explicit standards, architectural clarity, and cross-cutting governance. The project captures foundational rules and design intent that apply across all implementations—defining what Deevnet is, how it's meant to work, and what "correct" means. The philosophy treats undocumented workarounds as defects, regardless of functionality, and prioritizes making infrastructure management predictable by embedding knowledge in explicit documents rather than institutional memory.
