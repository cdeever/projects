# Ma Bell Bluetooth Gateway

An ESP32-based project that resurrects vintage rotary phones for modern use. The gateway emulates a telephone company's central office line and bridges classic analog phones to Bluetooth-connected devices—bringing the nostalgia of 1970s landline telephony into the modern wireless era.

The system delivers authentic telephone-line characteristics: proper DC voltage for subscriber loops, off-hook detection, ringing signals, and dial tone generation. At its core is the HC-5504B SLIC (Subscriber Line Interface Circuit), a telecom chip that implements the "BORSCHT" functions that Bell System central offices provided to every telephone line.

Lift the handset, get a dial tone, pulse dial a number, and make a call over Bluetooth. Incoming calls ring the actual bell.
